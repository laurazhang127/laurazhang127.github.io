When Titanic hit iceberg and sunk down, only one third of the passengers managed to survive. 
We know that there are a couple of factors that determine who had the prevelidge to get on lifeboat first, but I would say social class and gender plays a large part in it. 
This bar chart displays how survivors and deceased ones are distributed among different social classes (represented by Passenger Class) and genders, from which you can see that females from upper class have the biggest chance to survive. 

Each passenger class consists of 2 bars, one for the survivors and the other for the deceased ones. We can compare the people counts by bar height and also by actual figures. Also, the survivorship percentage of each passenger class is accessible through a button click-event and shows that first class has the highest chance to survive. Another button event enables us to see how female passengers distribute between life and death. 

Below are some feedbacks I got and how I updated my visualization afterwards. 
1. Title and SVG graph are not aligned well as title is placed in the center while graph sticks to the left. The title is then moved to the left. 
2. Click event is tagged to a rect, which doesn't look like something to be clicked on. Also, there's no choice to return to the initial image before click event. So I added 3 buttons instead, associating 2 buttons with percentage displaying events and 1 button with returning to initial graph event. 
3. Lables "PClass*" are not straightforward enough and there's no introductory information to present reader with the backgroud story. "PCalss" is replaced by "Passenger Class", to be more self-evident. A graph is added to introduce the Titanic tradegy and present the topic.
